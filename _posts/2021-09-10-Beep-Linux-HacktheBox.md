Beep is an easy rated box which involves a lot from enumeration. Knowing or learning how to navigate long enumeration results is crucial here. 

**ENUMERATION**

Nmap the IP address and the following results show: 
```
PORT      STATE SERVICE    VERSION

``` 
The results are quite abundant here. But what immediately stands out, is Apache running on port 80. Additionally, what could be another way in, is the ssh service on port 22. 

We can check out the https website in our browser. 
It looks like a redirect of port 443. And shows us a login page provided by Elastix. 

''*Elastix is an unified communications server software that brings together IP PBX, email, IM, faxing and collaboration functionality. It has a Web interface and includes capabilities such as a call center software with predictive dialing.*''

PBX stands for 'Private Branch Exchange' and is an internal telephone network for business.

 Since we have a website, we can try and scout for any directories of interest using Dirbuster. 
```
/index.php	    200	2151
/register.php	200	2151
/images	        200	178
/cgi-bin	    403	475
/help	        200	686
/icons	        200	178
/themes	        200	3370
/modules	    200	178
/admin	        302	215
/static	        200	1464
/mailman	    403	475
/mail	        200	336
/config.php	    200	2151
/pipermail	    200	882
/lang	        200 4996
/recordings	    ???	???
```  

After trying out a few of these, we quickly realise that we need credentials to either log in or just plainly have authorisation.

It seems we've enumerated enough for now. With what we have, we can try to find an exploit encompassing Elastix and PBX. 

**FOOTHOLD AND EXPLOITATION**

Using searchsploit, we can look up elastix in the console:
```
$ searchsploit elastix                                                                                1 тип

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
```  
The results show two very promising exploits: a Remote Code Execution exploit and a Local File Inclusion one. 

Looking at the LFI exploit we see:
```
Elastix is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to view files and execute local scripts in the context of the web server process. This may aid in further attacks.

Elastix 2.2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

print "\n read amportal.conf file : $answer \n\n";
print " successful read\n";
 
}
else { 
print "\n[-] not successful\n";
	}
``` 
Essentially, the exploit works on the fact that there is an LFI in the *vtigercrm/graph.php* directory. And this directory is accessible because of its incapability to filter its user input.
So visiting **https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action**, should allow us to read credentials. AMPortal credentials according to the exploit. 

The output is very messy and hard to read so we can open the page source in another tab instead. 
Here is the result:

```  
From this file alone, we get multiple passwords. My first instinct is to grab the Admin 'looking' credentials and try them out on various services we have.
We can successfully log into the Elastix and the FreePBX interface. 
When looking through the server status' for FreePBX we see the different services such as Asterisk, MySQL, SSH and the Web Server. These are all open and running, so we could try to access one of them. 

Since we saw the SSH service first on the Nmap scan, let's try it out. 
SSH-ing using the credentials does not work, until I remembered we needed to use a user name. Admin would equate to Root. 

We successfully login as root. 
Now we can find the flags. 
The flags were found in **/home/fanis/user.txtтАЛтАЛ** while the root flag was found in **/root/root.txt**.

Success!
